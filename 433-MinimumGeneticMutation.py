# A gene string can be represented by an 8-character long string, with choices from "A", "C", "G", "T".
#
# Suppose we need to investigate about a mutation (mutation from "start" to "end"), where ONE mutation is
# defined as ONE single character changed in the gene string.
#
# For example, "AACCGGTT" -> "AACCGGTA" is 1 mutation.
#
# Also, there is a given gene "bank", which records all the valid gene mutations. A gene must be in the
# bank to make it a valid gene string.
#
# Now, given 3 things - start, end, bank, your task is to determine what is the minimum number of mutations
# needed to mutate from "start" to "end". If there is no such a mutation, return -1.
#
# Note:
#
# Starting point is assumed to be valid, so it might not be included in the bank.
# If multiple mutations are needed, all mutations during in the sequence must be valid.
# You may assume start and end string is not the same.
# Example 1:
#
# start: "AACCGGTT"
# end:   "AACCGGTA"
# bank: ["AACCGGTA"]
#
# return: 1
# Example 2:
#
# start: "AACCGGTT"
# end:   "AAACGGTA"
# bank: ["AACCGGTA", "AACCGCTA", "AAACGGTA"]
#
# return: 2
# Example 3:
#
# start: "AAAAACCC"
# end:   "AACCCCCC"
# bank: ["AAAACCCC", "AAACCCCC", "AACCCCCC"]
#
# return: 3
